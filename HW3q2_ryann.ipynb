    "In this question, you will simulate a peptide design experiment, trying to find peptides with high binding affinity to MHC class I using a bayesian optimization approach. Notice the goal here is not trying to find a peptide sequence that maximize the binding affinity to MHC, Since a sizable proportion of the sequence data we are using contains maximum binding affinity out of the data (9.0). Using the same feature encoding as question 1, we will examine several techniques to maximize the percentage of sequence with affinity of 9.0 for stringent querying.\n",
